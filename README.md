# RoboTeamTwente Microcontroller v5.0

This repository contains the code that is running on the micro controller that is located in our robots. More specifically on the `STM32F767ZI` chip. 

This repository holds roughly two kinds of code. Local control code that is running on the robot and more generic embedded code that communicates with all the peripherals that are connected to the micro controller.

## Project Structure
All of the actual hardware code can be found in `Core`. In here the `main.c` file is fully generated by STMCubeMX, which abstracts away all the initialization needed for the micro controller itself. The main take away is that the the `robot.c` file contains the actual logic of the micro controller.

The `robot.c` contains the initialization phase and the main loop of our onboard code. 

Additionally, other directories abstract away more specific logic for peripherals (dribbler, wheels, buzzer and etc.), control logic (kalman filter, state control and yaw calibration).
