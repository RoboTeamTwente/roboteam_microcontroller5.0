/**
 * @brief Implementation to control the INA234
 * 
 * The INA234 is a digital current-sense amplifier with an I2C- and SMBus-compatible interface. The device reports
 * the sensed current and features programmable out-of-range limits to issue alerts when the current is outside
 * the normal range of operation. The integrated analog-to-digital converter (ADC) can be set to different averaging
 * modes and configured for continuous-versus-triggered operation.
